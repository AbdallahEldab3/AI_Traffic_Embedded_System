# AI_Traffic_Embedded_System
I developed a fully embedded AI-powered smart traffic management system that dynamically controls traffic lights based on real-time road density using computer vision. The system is also capable of detecting traffic violations such as wrong-way driving, illegally parked vehicles, and road accidents.
