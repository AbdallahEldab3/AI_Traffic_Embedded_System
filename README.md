AI-Powered Smart Traffic Management System
Embedded Computer Vision | Real-Time Traffic Optimization | Mobile Integration | On-Road Deployment Approved

I led the design and implementation of a fully embedded, AI-driven smart traffic system capable of dynamically controlling traffic lights based on real-time road conditions using computer vision. The system also detects traffic violations and enables direct response workflows for city authorities.

ðŸ”¹ System Capabilities
Dynamic Traffic Light Control: Real-time traffic density analysis from camera feeds, optimizing signal timing to reduce congestion and improve vehicle flow.

Violation and Anomaly Detection:

Wrong-way driving detection

Illegally parked vehicle detection

Accident detection through abnormal motion tracking and vehicle stoppage

Mobile App Integration:

For Citizens: A user-facing mobile application allows commuters to monitor live road conditions and receive alerts on congestion or incidents.

For Authorities: A control interface provides real-time violation reports and anomaly notifications to enable fast decision-making and remote intervention.

ðŸ”¹ Prototype Phase
Hardware: ESP32, toy vehicle models, and a Tapo C100 camera to simulate traffic environments.

Software: Lightweight YOLO models for real-time object detection; custom firmware to simulate traffic light states based on observed vehicle flow.

ðŸ”¹ Funded System Upgrade
Following initial success, the project received funding from the Academy of Scientific Research and Technology (ASRT) to develop a full-scale embedded solution:

Hardware:

Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB RAM) for onboard AI inference and control logic

Hikvision DS-2CD1027G0-L industrial IP camera for reliable high-resolution outdoor monitoring

Software Pipeline:

Optimized YOLOv8 for density estimation and event detection

On-device decision engine for real-time traffic control

Optional Firebase or MQTT integration for cloud-based alerts and remote updates

ðŸ”¹ Deployment and Impact
Presented to local government authorities and regional leadership.

Gained official permission to deploy and test the system on real urban roads under live traffic conditions.

Demonstrated significant potential for reducing congestion, improving emergency response, and supporting data-driven urban planning.
